# Image Generation API Setup

This application uses AI to generate realistic safety scenario images. 

## Primary: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (Optional)

To use Google Gemini for enhanced image generation:

1. **Get a FREE Google API Key:**
   - Go to https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Copy your key

2. **Add to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:**
   ```toml
   GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-google-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Benefits:**
   - Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash to enhance prompts
   - Better understanding of SAF context
   - More accurate military details
   - Free tier: 15 requests/minute, 1 million tokens/month

   - Uses Flux model

2. **Hugging Face** (Backup)
